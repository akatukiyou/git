# Git basic commands 

#  Create a new repo [git] on GitHub and locally
   001. Create a repo on git hub
   002. Create a local repo folder with the same name from step 1
   003. Create a new file
   004. git init
   005. git add .
   006. git commit -m "my first file in xx repo"
   007. git branch -M git-prod
        git branck
        git checkout 
   008. git remote add origin ssh-link-to-this-repo
   009. git push -u origin git-prod 
   010. git status

#   Create a new branch [git-dev] locally and push to GitHub
   001. git branch -M git-dev
   002. git checkout git-dev
   002. git push -u origin git-dev

#   Create a new branch [git-stg] locally and push to GitHub
   001. git checkout -b git-stg
   002. git push -u origin git-stg
   003. git branch

#   Delete branch locally
   001. git branch -d localBranchName
        # The -d option will delete the branch only if it has already been pushed and merged with the remote branch. 
        # Use -D instead if you want to force the branch to be deleted, even if it hasn't been pushed or merged yet.
        # 

#   Delete branch remotely        
   001. git push --delete origin remoteBranchName
   002. git push origin :remoteBranchName   # shorter cmd, same as 001.
        # If see error like this "error: unable to push to unqualified destination: remoteBranchName The destination refspec neither matches an existing ref on the remote nor begins with refs/, and we are unable to guess a prefix based on the source ref. error: failed to push some refs to 'git@repository_name'"
        # Meaning someone already deleted remote branch
        # Try synchronize the branch list
        git fetch -p   # -p means "prune"
        
#
