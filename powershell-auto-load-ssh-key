Use Windows 10 OpenSsh that integrated with system instead of Git OpenSSH
1. Start the `ssh-agent` from Windows Services: 
  - Enable [OpenSSH Authentication Agent] from [Services]
 

2. Make Git to use the Windows 10 implementation of OpenSSH by issuing the following command in Powershell: 
  - [git config --global core.sshCommand C:/Windows/System32/OpenSSH/ssh.exe]


3. Configure SSH to automatically add the keys to the agent on startup by editing [C:\Users\%YOUR_USERNAME%\.ssh\config]

Host *
	AddKeysToAgent yes
	IdentitiesOnly yes

  You can also add the following lines if you generated an SSH key with custom name or multiple SSH keys:

Host github.com
	HostName github.com
	User your_user_name
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/your_file_name


4. Add your SSH key to the [ssh-agent] by issuing the [ssh-add] command and entering your passphrase:

   [ssh-add $HOME/.ssh/your_file_name]


5. Done! Now restart your Powershell and even Windows if necessary.
